Applets are now deprecated in most modern browsers. However, there remain ways to run them:

1) From an IDE that supports applets, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA with its Java Applets Support plug-in from JetBrains; or
2) Using appletviewer, available in certain distributions of the JDK. For Windows, you'll need JDK8 and jli.dll - more info <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/69m2ol/running_legacy_java_applets_without_a_browser_or/'>here</a>. For macOS, there are instructions <a href='https://adamargyle.net/2020/04/21/supporting-java-applets-in-macos-catalina/'>here</a>.
